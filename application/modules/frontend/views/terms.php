Failure of any of the parties to insist in one or more instances on the strict performance of any of the covenants of this Agreement or to exercise any portion hereof contained, shall thereafter not be construed as abandonment or cancellation or waiver of such covenant or option by the party who failed to enforce the strict performance of the provisions of this Agreement. No waiver by herein parties shall be deemed to have been made unless expressed in writing and signed by the party who waives its rights under this Agreement.</p>



            <p><b>14. Entire Agreement</b> <br>
